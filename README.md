 Hey there,

My name is Archana and I'm a software engineer.

As a software engineer, I enjoy using my obsessive attention to detail, my unequivocal love for making things that change the world. That's why I like to make things that make a difference.

Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:

JavaScript (ES6+),
HTML & (S)CSS,
React,
Redux,
Node.js,
Express,
GraphQL,
Typescript,
PostgreSQL,
Firebase,
Java.
